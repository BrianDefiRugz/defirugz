    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is <strong>Brian Ahmed</strong>. I am 43 years old from Indianapolis, IN. My father is from Sudan, but I was born in Indiana. I go by King Petty on TG and X.

   help from a dev buddy of mine.</p>

    <h2>Why We Created This</h2>
    <p>
      After watching too many innocent people get scammed in the crypto space, I decided enough was enough. Iâ€™ve seen friends, family, and online communities lose real money to rugpulls, honeypots, and fake influencers pushing garbage tokens. The space was missing accountability â€” and I wasnâ€™t going to wait around for someone else to fix it.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      DeFi Rugz exists to bring justice to the decentralized world. Our mission is to build a transparent, community-powered protocol that exposes scams, slashes frauds, and rewards truth. Weâ€™re not here to play nice with scammers â€” weâ€™re here to end them. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're staking $RUGZ to vouch for legit projects, slashing the shady ones, or hunting for bounty rewards, youâ€™re part of the fight. This isn't just a token â€” it's a movement. Built for degens, by degens. And we donâ€™t forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      ðŸ”¥ Slash the scammers. Reward the truth. Only on Base.
